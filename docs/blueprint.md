# **App Name**: AttendanceZen

## Core Features:

- Wi-Fi/IP Validation: Validates attendance punches based on the employee's connection to the office's Wi-Fi/IP network.
- Automated Half-Day Detection: Automatically marks a half-day if an employee disconnects from the office Wi-Fi more than twice in a day.
- Employee Dashboard: Allows employees to punch attendance, apply for leave, submit regularization requests, view leave balance and half-day count, and track approval status.
- HR/Admin Dashboard: Allows HR/Admins to manage employee data, view attendance records, approve/reject leave and regularization requests, and monitor overall workforce attendance.
- Notifications: Sends real-time notifications for missed punches, leave approval/rejection, and automatic half-day updates.  The LLM is used as a tool to decide when, or if a missed punch requires immediate notification based on learned employee behavior patterns.
- Attendance History Visualization: Provides a calendar view with color-coded attendance records (Green = Present, Yellow = Half-Day, Red = Absent) for better transparency.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, trustworthy blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of calm efficiency, and referencing established conventions for user interfaces.  This color is suited to a professional environment while being inviting and familiar.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), providing a clean and neutral backdrop to emphasize the primary and accent colors.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#4DB6AC), complementing the primary blue to highlight interactive elements without causing excessive distraction.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, neutral, and highly readable experience across all devices.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different actions and statuses within the app.  Focus on clarity and recognizability.
- Employ a card-based layout to organize information clearly. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter and ensure a balanced, intuitive experience.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions and maintain engagement without causing distraction.
